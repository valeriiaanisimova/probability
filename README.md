Probability is an interactive web application that simulates and compares life scenarios based on various personal and professional parameters. Users can input data such as occupation, income, health habits, relationship status, and stress levels to estimate probabilities of achieving goals like financial success, health, and happiness by 2040. The application uses Monte Carlo simulations to model different outcomes and visualize potential life paths.
