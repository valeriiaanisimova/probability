Probability Project is an interactive simulation that visualizes how different life scenarios might unfold based on personal choices and habits. By adjusting parameters like occupation, income, health habits, and stress levels, users can estimate the probabilities of achieving goals such as financial success, health, and happiness by 2040. The app uses Monte Carlo simulations to model various outcomes and present potential life paths.
